- "Control+F12" WILL STOP ANY TRACERS AT ANY TIME (except plugin tracer if it was not
  managed).

- Maintain CONTROL or SHIFT for selecting several nodes in the tree. (like you select
  several files in Windows...)

- When you use the tracer level1 (Disasm), you can press and maintain "Shift" key for
  seeing all API calls in the redirected function. Just release it for getting the one
  which is currently shown in the MessageBox.

- Always try the tracer level1 before the other ones because it is "just" a disassembler.
  But it does not emulate instruction so do not expect to get a "jmp [eax*0x123456+0x654]"
  which will jump to GetModuleHandleA for example.

- Try the tracer level2 in the last resort and please try to close all your other running
  applications (like your favorite mp3 player for example...)

- 'AutoTrace' is just there to show how to rebuild <Notepad_asp.exe>. Always prefer manual
  trace

- If you are under Win9X/ME, do not forget to renormalize exports (only once in a windows
  session is enough) BEFORE launching your target.

- Do not forget you can "stick" several IAT intervals in your current imports. It means
  each time you click on <Get Imports> with different IAT infos, your current imports will
  not be removed.

- For invalid slots left which can't be resolved, try to use the loader (by applying
  *Switch Loader* on all invalid entries)

- You do not need to turn on all sections when using the 'Full Dump' button (Sorry, i
  admit this button is not well placed... but 'Full Dump' means dump *ALL*)

Safecast/Safedisc 2:
--------------------
Enable "Exact Call" in Options and use the Tracer Level3.

If the tracer failed on a slot, you will notice your target will be freezed. Unfortunately
it's not possible to recover it. Maintain CONTROL+F12 to stop the tracer and return to
ImportREC. Remember the last resolved function by the tracer and save your tree (all
resolved 'Exact Calls' will be saved so you will be able to continue where you were, later).
Kill the process of your target. Relaunch it, select it again in ImportREC and reload your
tree and continue to trace from the last resolved function (Invalidate it and retrace or
turn on 'Skip Main Slot' in Options to trace only on its Exact Calls).


ASProtect:
----------
The best way to rebuild it, is to trace with the Tracer Level1 all invalid entries.
Select all imports of Kernel32.dll, invalidate them and trace with the Plugin Tracer for
ASProtect. Finally for all invalid entries left, retrace with the Tracer Level1.

(If there are still some invalid entries, right click on them, do *Switch Loader* and let
all parameters to default when fixing your dump)


tELock:
-------
The Tracer Level3 will work. You will have to do "Show Invalid" and "Cut Thunk(s)" to
remove all false entries which are in fact the NULL DWORD of the IAT structure (it is the
separator between each different module which is easy to locate by looking at the module
names of the previous and next slots).


VBOX:
-----
The Tracer Level3 should work. If the tracer returns a code of 313 (which means TimeOut),
you will have to increase the TimeOut in Options because it is slow (11 seconds about for
the slowest api slot on my 1700 XP).

Under Win9x, you could get a GPF of the module <vboxta.dll> when tracing. To avoid it,
'block' your target (with a 'jmp eip' at the OEP for example) before tracing into it
(Thanks to ZigD for this 'trick').

Anyway that GPF does not happen if you are under NT, 2k and XP.


PeX:
----
Increase the <Max Recursion> (to 10h for example) in Options and use the Tracer Level1.
You will have to do "Show Invalid" and "Cut Thunk(s)" to remove all faked entries left
(They are only stuck at the begining and/or the end of the real IAT and have almost the
same pointer).
