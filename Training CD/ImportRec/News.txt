ImpREC is back to public. This version can now support Windows 95 (Thanks to EliCZ,
Unknown One and ZigD for testing).
It has also been redesigned to support more import rebuilding schemes (relative calls for
example). The plugin interface has changed completely (using filemapping) and now supports
the 'Exact Call' feature. This last one has been linked with the 'Create New IAT'. It will
be useful for all mangled schemes which annihilate completely or partially the IAT. The
'AutoTrace' is more stable because it will not use the Tracer Level2 anymore. A built-in
coloured disassembler/hew-viewer will help you to watch the redirected code. Then you
should not need the ASProtect plugin because of no more updates but it still is there as
example. Please take a look at <History.txt> for all details.

I hope you will enjoy this version like i did to make it,
Regards,
