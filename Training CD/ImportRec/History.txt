	- Tracer Level3
		- New approach (Thanks to EliCZ)
			- Support SEH chain
			- No more FS instructions emulation

	- Tested under NT4 (Thanks to Unknown One)
	- The Import Editor (double click on a function) will look for the nearest valid
	  function in the thunk and will get its module name. => Much faster when editing
	  each function by hand.
	- Improved 'Exact Call' (It will not retrace all exact calls from a slot if they
	  have already been resolved)
	- New Module Loader (It should be faster)
	- Support function names which have more than 256 characters. ImportREC left when
	  clicking on <Get Imports> (Thanks to ToyBomB and shandi for reports)
	- <Save Log> added (Right click on the Log listbox)

	  even when you have selected several slots to trace

	- Added a filter to "Get API Calls" to get valid addresses only

  NT/2000... It's now reactivated under those systems (even if your exe will not be
  portable to another system)
- Fixed a GPF (oops! :-P) when invalidate some particular APIs
- Load and Save Tree Models
- Enable and Disable controls (buttons and editboxes) when necessary
- Tracer level2 is slower (not under Win2000! ;-)) but less buggy than previous version

  ImportREC will be able to rebuild a 100% portable executable (or very close) with it.

  ** Double-click on the function in the "Import Functions Found" list and choose the good
     API.
