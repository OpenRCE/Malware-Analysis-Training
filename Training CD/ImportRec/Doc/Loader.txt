The loader allows you to rip any wrapped code, reinject it in your dump and do
relocs/import_rebuilding for trying to get a working code. The reloc job is very hard to
implement so do not expect a miracle from it but it will do its best.
This feature will fit for packers/protectors which emulate API or remove the whole IAT and
redirect all calls to this IAT.


This is an irc log about the purpose of the Loader: (Greetings to LaBBa)

<L> do u have an answer about how to manage fake api of aspr?
<L> i mean that after the file was rebuilt by imprec the file still crashes
    because it calls an api that aspr owns
<M> try to use the loader. do you know the address of these apis? if yes, add them
    into your imports and switch the loader on them. Then fix the dump.
<M> imprec will try to rip the code and reinject it into your dump
<M> ... the loader is experimental, i can't ensure you it will work 100%
<L> how do i load them into the imports? (i need to dump another file?)
<M> no, imprec can do that automatically (it's a feature nobody uses except ZigD
    and me at the moment)
<M> you just have to know what addresses miss into your dump and add them into the
    tree (to add them : enter the RVA and a Size of 4 in the IAT editboxes infos
    and click on <Get Imports>)
<M> (it will be ADDED into your current imports (your current imports WILL NOT be
    removed))
<M> ok let's explain in details how the loader works:
<M> when you <*Switch Loader*> on a slot, you will see the tag "*Loader*" near the
    whole module (the module can stay invalid, it's not a problem)
<M> so for your case, SUPPOSE the aspr api is a call at address 402000 (in VA) like
    this: call [402000] (where at 402000, you have a pointer 'Y' to the faked api)
<M> now we suppose you already have your imports which are complete and good
<M> moreover, you know in your dump, you will miss that api at 402000
<M> then add it to your current imports : enter 2000 in the IAT and 4 for the size
    (we suppose the imagebase is 400000)
<M> (another way to get it, is to use the <Get API Calls> command (right click on the tree))
<M> you should get an invalid module w/o name + a function with the invalid pointer 'Y'
<M> right click on that function and select <*Switch Loader*>
<M> now fix your dump (let that pointer invalid, it's IMPORTANT)
<M> when fixing the dump, imprec will see that invalid pointer and know it will be for
    the loader so it will rip the region(s) which contains the code at address <Y>,
    and inject it into your dump (you will see a dialogbox which will show you the ripped
    region(s) just after browsing your dump)
<M> it will also add a loader which will modify at entrypoint, the pointer <Y> to
    point to the ripped code
<L> cool!
<M> so when your proggy will call that aspr api, it will call the ripped code
<M> unfort, it does not work 100% yet because of problems on relocs (the current
    relocs analyzer is pure heuristics... and it will stay for a long moment :-))
<L> it will be gr8 if in the next version u will add a full explainations about that
    (just copy all that u told me to a file...... ;)
<M> good idea :-)
