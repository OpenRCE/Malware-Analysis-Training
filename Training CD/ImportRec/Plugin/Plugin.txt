Put your DLLs here and they will appear in the popup menu when right-clicking on the
imports tree.

This is the way you have to follow:
-----------------------------------

	- Export a function named "Trace" which takes 5 parameters (5 DWORDs).

	  Its C Prototype is:

		- DWORD Trace(DWORD hFileMap, DWORD dwSizeMap, DWORD dwTimeOut,
		              DWORD dwToTrace, DWORD dwExactCall);

		where:
			- hFileMap      : HANDLE of the file mapped by ImportREC
			- dwSizeMap     : Size of the mapped file
			- dwTimeOut     : TimeOut in ImportREC Options
			- dwToTrace     : The pointer to trace (in VA)
			- dwExactCall   : The EIP of the 'Exact Call' (in VA)
			                  (this value is 0 when it is not an 'Exact Call')

	- Error returned codes should be greater or equals to 200. They will be shown in
	  ImportREC when it is finished to call it

	- Create a Map View with the handle <hFileMap> provided (API: MapViewOfFile) to
	  get a pointer to the mapped file (Thanks to EliCZ for advices)

		* Do not forget to Unmap the view and close the handle <hFileMap> when
		  finished
	
	- When you find the real API, write in the mapped file (at offset 0) the address
	  of the API (in VA)


Notes:
------
	
	- All you do in your DLL will be executed in the context of your target.

	- If <dwExactCall> is not null, it is the address in VA of the call to the API in
	  the code.

	  Example:

		You trace a slot at an RVA 1000 with 'Exact Call' enabled and in the
                code of the target, you have: 402000 CALL [1000+image_base]

		Then your "Trace" function will be called with a <dwExactCall> equals
		to 402000. If you find the real API, ImportREC will fix the code later
	        to point it to the good IAT place.
	
	- If you manage to write a ring0/3 tracer, you will have to jump into the pointer
          to trace and manage all exceptions by yourself. I advise you to create a thread
	  before tracing in it.
