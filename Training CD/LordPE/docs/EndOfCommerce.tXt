
LordPE is FREEWARE since its birthday (25th March 2002). Analog
to WinAMP it switched from commercial to non-commercial software.
THANKS TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO PAID FOR IT!
You kept me up coding new versions in spite of a lack of time.

I also knew that the shareware principle works nowhere worse than
in the reverse engineering scene. It was actually an idea by a
very good real-life-friend who hasn't got much to do with PCs.
I collected nice experiences by that but all in all it was a stupid
action.

While coding the first version of LordPE, my plan was even to make
it freeware + open source. Today the situation looks different.
LordPE is grown since his first release and I don't like the idea
of making more than 21.000 lines of code accessible for everyone.

Tout est bien qui fini bien :)
