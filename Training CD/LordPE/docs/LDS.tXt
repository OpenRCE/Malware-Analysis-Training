              LordPE Dumper Server - plugin developer's references
              ----------------------------------------------------
              
Prolog
------
Since the 'Gathering' version includes LordPE a plugin interface with the name
LordPE Dumper Server (in a nutshell: LDS) which provides the following features:
- dump process modules and rebuild them
- dump process module blocks
- task tracer which provides module... - pathes
                                       - ImageBase/ImageSize
                                       - one can search a PID with an (incomplete)
                                         path as input

The interface system
--------------------
The communication system is relative equal to the one of ProcDump. First one has to
receive the window handle of LDS by the 'FindWindow' API ("LDS_WND_NAME").
Afterwards one can interact with LDS by 'SendMessage' calls which have the following
prototype:

void SendMessage(              - no return value !
  HWND hWnd,                   - LDS window Handle
  UINT Msg,                    - WM_LDS_CMD_XXX action command
  WPARAM wParam,               - Process ID of the plugin
  LPARAM lParam                - pointer to a LDS_XXX structure
);

The LDS SDK supports the following programming languages/compilers through the
fitting include files:
- C(++)
- MASM/TASM/NASM
- Delphi
- Visual Basic

There's a command line parameter for LordPE.exe ("/LDS%modifiers%") which causes
that LDS will be lunched directly. Look at 'ReadMe.tXt' or the MASM plugin example
for more information.

Notes
-----
Have a look at the include files or the example plugins (C, Delphi, ASM) for a
demo on how to use LDS live. All include files are equal commented with the
exception that 'LDS.h' provides the INput and OUTput tags which sign input and
output structure elements. All commands/structures should be self explaining.

Some things are commented now...

(1)
Dumped process module images or memory blocks can either be saved by a save
dialog of LDS or the output will be saved to a memory buffer being accessible
by the client, so the plugin can handle the dumped data itself. This concerns the
following 2 structures for dumping operations:

typedef struct _LDS_FULL_DUMP
{
	IN     DWORD         dwStructSize;
	IN     DWORD         dwFlags;                                  // LDS_DUMP_XXX/LDS_REB_XXX
	IN     DWORD         dwPID;
	IN     HMODULE       hModuleBase;                              // NULL - calling module is dumped
	OUT    BOOL          bDumpSuccessfully;
	OUT    DWORD         dwSizeOfDumpedImage;
	OUT    BOOL          bUserSaved;                               // LDS_DUMP_SAVEVIAOFN
	OUT    char          cSavedTo[MAX_PATH];                       // LDS_DUMP_SAVEVIAOFN
	OUT    void*         pDumpedImage;                             // !LDS_DUMP_SAVEVIAOFN

	// rebuilding structure elements
	IN     DWORD         dwRealignType;                            // 0-normal 1-hardcore 2-nice
	IN     DWORD         dwNewImageBase;                           // format: 0xXXXX0000
} LDS_FULL_DUMP, *PLDS_FULL_DUMP;

typedef struct _LDS_PARTIAL_DUMP
{
	IN     DWORD         dwStructSize;
	IN     DWORD         dwPID;
	IN     void*         pBlock;
	IN     DWORD         dwBlockSize;
	IN     BOOL          bSaveViaOfn;
	OUT    BOOL          bDumpSuccessfully;
	OUT    BOOL          bUserSaved;                               // bSaveViaOfn
	OUT    char          cSavedTo[MAX_PATH];                       // bSaveViaOfn
	OUT    void*         pDumpedImage;                             // !bSaveViaOfn
} LDS_PARTIAL_DUMP, *PLDS_PARTIAL_DUMP;

"STRUCT.bSaveViaOfn"  - Indicates whether the output should be saved by the user through
                        a LDS save dialog ("STRUCT.bUserSaved" + "STRUCT.cSavedTo"
                        are valid) or will be saved to a memory buffer ("STRUCT.pDumpedImage"
                        is valid)
                        The buffer is freed automatically either when LDS is closed or a
                        new dump is performed.
"STRUCT.bUserSaved"   - Indicates whether the user did cancel the save dialog or not. Only
                        if 'bUserSaved' is TRUE, "STRUCT.cSavedTo" is valid.
              
(2)                        
Due to the fact that LDS doesn't respond directly to commands with a success or an error,
one has to check the success of the LDS command in a different way. Error checking is not
always necessary but can be done in the following way:

    (...)
    LDS_FIND_PID.dwPID = -1;
    SendMessage(
        LDSWindowHandle,
        WM_LDS_CMD_FINDPROCESSID,
        WParam(ClientPid),
        LParam(address of LDS_FIND_PID));
    if (LDS_FIND_PID.dwPID == -1)
    {
        // an error occurred
        (...)
    }
    (...)

Near the EOF
------------
It would be nice to see some plugins :D
If you can say of yourself that you did so, then please send your plugin to LordPE@gmx.net.
