                     Developing a LordPE Dumper Engine (LDE)
              ----------------------------------------------------
              
Prolog
------
Since LordPE Deluxe coders are able to develop their own process dump engines. That means
LordPE doesn't handle anymore the job to grab the bytes from the target process memory -
your code does it.
Using a user defined LDE affects the following LordPE features:
	- full module dump
	- partial module dump
	- dumping a process memory region
	- LordPE Dumper Server

This could be useful to handle special processes which LordPE originally could not dump.
E.g.: .NET CLR process modules (have a look at the IntelliDump source code).

You can select the currently active LDE engine in the popup menu of the process or
module list of the main dialog.

The interface system
--------------------
LDEs reside in DLL files and have to be saved in <LordPE_base_dir>\LDE\. These DLLs have
to have the .lde extension. The number of LDEs is limited to 50. They must export the
following 3 routines (all in STDCALL calling convention!):

PSTR STDCALL GetLDEName();
	
	Remarks:
	This function is called by LordPE to find out the name of the LDE and pastes it into
	its popup menus. GetLDEName() should return a pointer to a NUL terminated ANSI string.

BOOL STDCALL DumpProcessRange(
	IN  DWORD dwProcessId,
	IN  void* pStartAddr,
	IN  DWORD dwcBytes,
	OUT void* pDumpedBytes,
	OUT char* szErrorStr
);

	Remarks:
	This function is the workhorse of each LDE. The argument list should be self
	explaining. If you return FALSE as result, LordPE will show the error string
	being saved to the 'szErrorStr' buffer to the user. This buffer is limited
	to 1024 characters (including the terminating NUL).

void STDCALL ShowLDEInfo(
	IN HWND hwndParent
);

	Remarks:
	This method just exists to show an about box, explain something, greet someone
	or something like that.

Each time LordPE fires up it creates a log file (LDELoad.log) in \LDE\ with information
according to the LDE load procedure.

Near the EOF
------------
It would be nice to see some LDEs :D
If you can say of yourself that you did so, then please send your plugin to LordPE@gmx.net.
