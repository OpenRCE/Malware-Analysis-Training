                               for Windows 9x/ME/NT/2K


Intro:
------
SoftSnoop is a single process, multi-thread debugger for executable PE files
which is able to spy API calls and uses the Debug API's to show the common debug events.
SoftSnoop is freeware !
It's full written with VC++6 using ANSI C (about 8700 lines).

Limitations:
------------
SoftSnoop doesn't trap any Api calls of MFC - dlls and of MSVCRT.dll
because this causes problems ! Imports of non dlls will be ignored, too.

Important notes:
----------------
- Try to disable/enable "Set Exceptions handled" (in the option menu) if a program
  stops in a loop of the same exception. This works in most cases.
- The breakpoints in the Int3-breakpoint list are set before the entrypoint of
  the debuggee is reached or if you click on "Set BP's".
- You can't stop at the DEBUG BREAK and set then a breakpoint with "Set BP's" at the
  entrypoint because this process memory is already modified by forcelibrary.dll,
  so you've to write the breakpoint in the breakpoint list before you start the
  debuggee or simply use the "Stop at EntryPoint" Option.
- The button/menu item to modify API parameters is only enabled after you set a
  breakpoint on the target API and SoftSnoop breaks on its execution.
- You can't set BPM's on win2k (NT4 dunno) at the DEBUG BREAK because at this 
  time the main thread has a pseudo context. Use the option to stop at the EntryPoint
  to set BPM's in that case.
- You can add default API names in SoftSnoop's ini file. The ordinal is interpreted as
  decimal !
- "Don't trap Imports of the following dlls" in the option menu is for the following
  purpose: If the Debuggee imports functions of dlls which aren't loaded into shared memory
  SS crashes sometimes after trapping these imports, so you simply can prevent SS from
  processing the imports of these dlls.
- Option: "Show TID of events"
  Api return events aren't sorted by TID !
- To modify the return value of APIs either use the "Modify API return value" dialog or use
  this trick:
  First put a breakpoint on any API and break on it. Find out the current return address of
  the API call via the "Modify API Stack" dialog. Set a BPX on execution at this address.
  This is the address of SoftSnoop's handler for API calls returning. Enable this BPM if you
  want to break at the moment the next API call returns. If you break then simply open the
  "View registers" dialog and modify EAX to what ever you want and save the changes. You've 
  to disable the BPM to continue execution...

...I hope the rest is self explaining.
