About ss-files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The API parameter definition used by SoftSnoop are stored in *.ss files.
SoftSnoop will make use of all ss - files being in a subdirectory named
"ApiDef".
The number of ss files is limited to 100.
If you want to create a ss file for a dll named e.g. "blah" then you've to
name the ss file "blah.ss" !
All API Definitions are in the following format:

-APINAME
[Numbers for parameter types]

APINAME is case sensitive !
The following parameter types are known by SoftSnoop:

For an example have a look at the ss files which were released with this
SoftSnoop version.
If someone had the time to create more complete ss files than I did then
please mail them to me.
