 PESnoop 2.0 - Advanced PE32/PE32+/COFF OBJ,LIB command line dumper by yoda

version:         2.0

project start:   27th March 2002

Prolog:
~~~~~~~
Basically I only wanted to code a structure lister for LordPE, like the one of PEBrowse, but
because I was currently interested in the changes made to the PE format while porting it to
64bit architectures and a core GUI structure lister isn't really code I can reuse, I developed
a full PE32/PE32+ command line dumper with support for related file types (OBJ, LIB).
My development environment was this time VS .NET...got to like it quickly.
Matt Pietrek's new PE article gave me fine input about the new PE format.
I just played some PE32+ files during development of this utility, so I couldn't test all PE
element dumpers on them.
Please send incompatible/wrong dumped files to me.
