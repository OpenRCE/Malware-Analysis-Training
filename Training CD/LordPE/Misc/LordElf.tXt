This is a little dumper for 32bit/LSB ELF formatted files (executables/object/...
files). I wrote it because one day I suddenly saw ElfCrypt by JunkCode on the web
and was interested in the ELF stuff.

I didn't tested in on very much files, so maybe there are relatively many bugs in
it. Would be nice if you send me unsupported files.

Usage: LordElf.exe (file path) (options)
         /NOLOGO    - suppress program information
         /ELF       - dump ELF header
         /PROGHDR   - dump Program Header Table
         /OBJ       - dump Object Header Table
         /DYN       - dump Dynamic information
         /INTERP    - dump Program Interpreter
         /SYM       - dump Symbol Table
         /DYNSYM    - dump Dynamic Symbol Table
         /REL       - dump Relocation information (not ElfXX_Rela items)
         /NOTE      - dump Note information
         /HASH      - dump Hash Table
         /GOT       - dump Global Offset Table
         /PLT       - dump Procedure Linkage Table
         /ALL       - dump all elements
