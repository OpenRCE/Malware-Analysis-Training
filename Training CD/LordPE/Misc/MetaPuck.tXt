[Intro]
MetaPuck is a tool to spy the information, being hidden in the MetaData
block inside the CLR (Common Language Runtime) Portable Executeable images
of the .NET framework, and displays it in a well overlookable TreeView.
This includes:
      CLR header, MetaData header, Assembly references, module references,
      class structures, enum types, structs, methods, fields (variables),
      interfaces, properties, attributes, user strings, events, ....

[Inside MetaPuck]
Because the raw structures of metadata blocks aren't documented, you
are forced to use either the unmanaged COM interfaces IMetaDataImport,
IMetaDataAssemblyImport,... (mscorwks.dll needed) or the Reflection
API of the .NET CLR.

command line:
		MetaPuck.exe [input file path]
		
MetaPuck supports drag'n'drop, too.

[Disclaimer]
If your computer explodes due to the usage of MetaPuck, it's not my
problem.

[Licence]
As usual the full source code of the project, which was developed in
VS7, is available. Your are able to use PARTS of this code if you
don't forget to mention my name and/or website (recommended :) anywhere.

[Acknowledge]
Thanks to Matt Pietrek for his MetaData article and source code.
The metainfo programm of the .NET Framework examples helped me a lot,
too while developing MetaPuck. The signature scanning algorithm to
receive routine information (return value, argument count/type, calling
conversion) was nearly completely ripped.

[Todo]
+ Add a MSIL disassembling engine
+ show permissions
+ show custom attributes
+ list ManifestResources
