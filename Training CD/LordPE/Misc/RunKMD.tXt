RunKMD 1.1
----------
coded by yoda (30th Apr 2k+1)

This is just another of these KMD (Kernel Mode Driver) installers. You can use
this little tool to register, start, stop and unregsiter KMD's under NT/2k. (just
tested on 2k).
I coded it to get familiar with this stuff and so that I can use my own proggy for
these purposes ;)

Command line:
 RunKMD <driver name> (driver path) [OPTIONS]
 Options:
 /REG           - register driver, driver path must be specified
 /UNREG         - unregister driver
 /RUN           - start driver
 /STOP          - stop driver
 /DEVICEIO=X    - pass control code X (in hex) to the driver
 Quotes are allowed and options must be interrupted by spaces.

HaVe PhUn !
