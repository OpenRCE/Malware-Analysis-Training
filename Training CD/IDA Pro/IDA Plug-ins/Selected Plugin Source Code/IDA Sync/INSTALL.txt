-----[ IDA Sync Plugin

Copy the ida_sync.plw file to your IDA plugins directory. Next, Modify the
plugins.cfg file to include the hotkeys. I recommend the following settings
which simply adds the 'Alt' key as a modifier to the default hotkeys.

    ; IDA Sync Hotkeys
        IDA_Sync_-_Indented_Comment         ida_sync  Alt-:        1
        IDA_Sync_-_Repeatable_Comment       ida_sync  Alt-Shift-R  2
        IDA_Sync_-_Name                     ida_sync  Alt-N        3
        IDA_Sync_-_Push_All_Function_Names  ida_sync  Alt-Shift-P  4

The distributed plugin is compiled for IDA v4.7, source code is included if you
want to compile for other versions. A message similar to the following should
appear in the log window when IDA starts up:

    [*] ida_sync initialized. Compiled on Mar  1 2005

Hit Alt+Shift+C to launch the ida_sync server connect dialog and
establish a connection with the server.

-----[ IDA Sync Server

The Sync Server requires Python v2.4 and currently runs on win32 only. The
requirements on v2.4 and Windows are specific to the Metakit interface that
I bundled with the package. To run on *nix or with Python 2.3, simply swap the
following files from the support directory:

    - Mk4py.dll
    - mk4vc60.dll
    - metakit.py

Metakit and the related Python binding are available from:

    http://www.equi4.com/metakit.html

The next step is to create the users database as well as a database for any
projects you wish to synchronize with IDA sync. The users.py script was written
to manage users:

    $ ./users.py
    usage: users [add|delete|validate <username>] [list]

To add the user 'pedram' and 'test':

    $ ./users.py add pedram
    password>
    realname> pedram amini

    $ ./users.py add test
    password>
    realname> test user

    $ ./users.py list
    pedram, pedram amini
    test, test user

The file, users.db, should be created in the databases directory if it doesn't
already exist. The dbs.py script was written to manage projects:

    $ ./dbs.py
    usage: dbs <module> [list] [<create|drop|dump> <proj>]

The module argument will always be 'ida_sync'. The reason this argument even
exists is that the server was written in a modular fashion to allow for other
components. To create a project for the latest Gaobot variant for example:

    $ ./dbs.py ida_sync create gaobot
    create view: gaobot

    $ ./dbs.py ida_sync list
    views: gaobot

Once database setup is complete you can now launch the server:

    $ ./ida_sync_server.py
    Server v1.0 ready.

The server will default to listening on all addresses and binding to port 5041.
These defaults can be overridden on the command line:

    $ ./ida_sync_server.py 10.10.0.100 1234
    Server v1.0 ready.

The users 'test' and 'pedram' can now individually connect to the IDA Sync
server for the Gaobot variant they are analyzing and synchronize their efforts
in real-time.
