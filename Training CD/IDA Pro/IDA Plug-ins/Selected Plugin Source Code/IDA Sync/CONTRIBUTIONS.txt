    - Fixed WINSOCK name resolution in IDAconnector::server_connect so it always works and fixed order of calls to initialize WINSOCK for proper DNS resolution.
    - Added support for renaming stack variables.
    - Fixed name hook to use appropriate flags on name change.
    - Added hook for publishing all function names to the server.

    - Moved WSAStartup() call above the host name resolution in IDAconnector::server_connect. Was causing issues in some cases.
